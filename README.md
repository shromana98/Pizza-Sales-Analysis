# Pizza-Sales-Analysis

# Objective
"Slice and Dice: Unveiling the Secrets of Pizza Sales Analysis"

To create a Pizza Sales  Analytics dashboard using Power Bi.

# This project aims at exploring the answers to the following questions:

1. How many customers do they have each day? Are there any peak hours?

2. How many pizzas are typically in an order? Do they have any bestsellers?

3. How much money did they make this year? Can they indentify any seasonality in the sales?

4. Are there any pizzas we should take of the menu, or any promotions we could leverage?
